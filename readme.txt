the "all_c" file applies to all classes
each of the other files only applies to one class according to its name

each line lists an item and its dropchances
"columns" are separated by a spacebar (" ")
the first column indicates the item name:
"..."_up means that the player receives an item of that type of higher quality, so stone axe instead of wooden axe or diamond boots instead of iron boots
if the item name starts with a number followed by an underscore ("_") then this number indicates the max level of that enchantment; the given rarity applies for the lvl 1 enchantment and every higher lvl enchantment is twice as rare as the previous enchantment lvl
the second column indicates the rarity; an item with rarity 9 will appear about 3 times as often as an item with rarity 3
the 3rd and 4th column indicate min and max amount received
the 5th column either contains an "e", an "a" or an "l"; "e" items will gradually appear less often between waves 10 and 50 and never appear beyond level 50, "l" items will gradually appear more often between waves 10 and 50 but never appear before wave 10, "a" items will appear equally often no matter the wave count
